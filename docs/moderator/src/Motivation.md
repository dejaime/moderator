# Motivation
 
This crate was created as a way to explore some more advanced features of the Rust language that I did not have a chance to use.
 
It tries to create a flexible and easy to integrate a mod / expansion / DLC pipeline for Bevy games. This means allowing mods not only to access existing components and resources, but also create new ones, add new systems, etcetera.
 
It aims to allow high moddability, allowing mod authors to touch even the core systems of the game; like Minecraft.
 
The idea is to have two levels of integration:
 - Scripting language
 - Direct Rust integration

More details on the language R&D coming up next.

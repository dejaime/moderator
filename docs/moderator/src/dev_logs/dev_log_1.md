# Dev Log 1

Researching viable runtimes led me to realize that I should start prototyping with `Mun` before I can actually make a decision on how usable it actually is.
On paper it sounds amazing, need some experimentation and dogfoodnig before I can actually commit to this.

For that, I'll need to create both the base crate as well as an example game project to go with it. Not even sure how to go about this though.
